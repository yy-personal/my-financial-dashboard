## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-financial-dashboard.git
   cd my-financial-dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

```
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm test -- --watch      # Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --coverage   # Generate test coverage report
```

### Building for Production

```
npm run build
```

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

To deploy this application to GitHub Pages:

1. Install the GitHub Pages package as a dev dependency:
   ```
   npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   ```

2. Add the following fields to your `package.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/my-financial-dashboard",
     "scripts": {
       "predeploy": "npm run build",
       "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Deploy the application:
   ```
   npm run deploy
   ```

4. Access your deployed application at the URL specified in the homepage field

#### Troubleshooting GitHub Pages Deployment

- Ensure your repository is set to use GitHub Pages in the repository settings
- For a project site, set the source to the `gh-pages` branch
- If using a custom domain, configure it in the GitHub repository settings

### Code Style and Quality

We follow established React best practices:

- Functional components with hooks
- Component composition for reusability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Thorough testing

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Custom Hooks for Complex Logic**
   - Abstracted complex state management into reusable hooks
   - Separated UI from business logic for better testability

2. **Component Composition**
   - Used smaller, single-responsibility components
   - Composed complex UIs from simple building blocks

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implemented error boundaries at strategic points
   - Graceful degradation when components fail

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Memoization of expensive calculations
   - Optimized rendering with React hooks
   - Code splitting for improved loading times

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for individual components and hooks
   - Integration tests for user flows
   - Mocked external dependencies for predictable tests

## Roadmap
